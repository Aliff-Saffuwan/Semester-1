## Reflection
On 29 October 2025, I attended a one-hour talk on system development presented by Mr. Helmee Bin Yaacob, a Senior IT Officer from the Department of Digital Services at UTMDigital. Then, we had the opportunity to interview another staff member, Mr. Nasrul, regarding the implementation of computer networks and security at UTMDigital network system.  

Throughout the visit, I was able to deepen my understanding of my current course of study, particularly in the area of system development. There were also several exhibitions showcasing recent technologies presented by the UTMDigital team. Attending both the talk and the exhibitions has undoubtedly increased my interest in Computer Science and inspired me to further my education in cybersecurity.  

Overall, the event was a success. However, I do believe that some improvement can be made by increasing interaction between the speaker and the audience, maybe by extending the session duration. Additionally, since the exhibition area was somewhat crowded, I do think that the management should be considering to provide a more spacious layout for next year’s UTMDigital Open Day.
