## Reflection
During this session, we worked in teams and were given a computer to practice disassembling and reassembling.
With the guidance of the support staff, I’d say we definitely killed it! 
We followed every step and procedure correctly to avoid damaging delicate components, such as the processor. 
We documented the entire process part by part, which kept us from making mistakes. 
Then, after the assembly activity we took a short quiz on what we had learned. 
Overall, it was an amazing experience. Thank you Dr. Azurah and all the staff members for this opportunity!
